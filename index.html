            <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Sharon!</strong></p>
            <p>
                I’m a third year computer science student at Cal Poly SLO and I’m passionate about building <em>cool web applications</em> 
                and exploring the potential of <em>AI</em>, with a vision to combine the two in exciting ways. My journey as a developer has led 
                me to work on various projects, including a <strong>merch-portal</strong> where I implemented a dynamic shopping experience, 
                and a <strong>music review platform</strong> designed to provide users with a seamless way to rate and discover new music.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond web development, I’ve also had hands-on experience with AI. Over the summer, I worked with the <strong>Jetson Nano</strong> 
                fine-tuning the Resnet-18 model to be able to properly detect a rubber duck and dropping it into a bin with the help of Apriltags. 
                This project gave me a deeper understanding of computer vision and robotics, fueling my curiosity about AI’s real-world applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it’s crafting intuitive web interfaces, building scalable systems, or experimenting with AI-driven automation, 
                I’m always driven by <em>curiosity</em> and a desire for <strong>continuous learning</strong>. 
                I look forward to bringing these interests together in future projects, 
                bridging the gap between <strong>web development</strong> and <strong>AI</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this site, you'll find my latest work, including the AI-applications and web projects I’ve been creating. 
                Let’s connect and explore new possibilities together!
            </p>
