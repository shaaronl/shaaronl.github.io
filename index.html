                    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Sharon!</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        I’m a third year computer science student at Cal Poly SLO and I’m passionate about building <em>cool web applications</em> 
                        and exploring the potential of <em>AI</em>, with a vision to combine the two in exciting ways. My journey as a developer has led 
                        me to work on various projects, including a <strong>merch-portal</strong> where I implemented a dynamic shopping experience, 
                        and a <strong>music review platform</strong> designed to provide users with a seamless way to rate and discover new music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond web development, I’ve also had hands-on experience with AI. Over the summer, I worked with the <strong>Jetson Nano</strong> 
                        fine-tuning the Resnet-18 model to be able to properly detect a rubber duck and dropping it into a bin. 
                        This project gave me a deeper understanding of computer vision and robotics, fueling my curiosity about AI’s real-world applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether it’s crafting intuitive web interfaces or experimenting with AI-driven automation, 
                        I’m always driven by <em>curiosity</em> and a desire for <strong>continuous learning</strong>. 
                        I look forward to bringing these interests together in future projects, 
                        bridging the gap between <strong>web development</strong> and <strong>AI</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On this site, you'll find my latest work, including the applications and web projects I’ve been creating. 
                        Let’s connect and explore new possibilities together!
